    "reference_answer": "Yes, Assistant Teaching Professors are expected to be promoted after usually 6 years at that rank. Failure to be promoted results in dismissal from the teaching professor ranks. Medical leaves, including pregnancy/childbirth leaves, may extend the time permitted at the Assistant rank.",

Assistant teaching professors are expected to be promoted after, usually, six years at rank. Failure to be promoted from assistant teaching professor to associate teaching professor results in dismissal from the teaching professor ranks.\n\nExtensions to this time at the assistant rank are permitted in certain circumstances. Medical leaves, including leaves for pregnancy and childbirth, are instances that may extend this time. Additionally, family leave or medical leave during the academic semester may also lead to an extension of the contract terms and promotion clock by up to one year, with a maximum of two extensions per contract.",
    "custom_response": "In the teaching professor ranks, appointments are usually nine-month, full-time positions with contracts for two to three years at the assistant rank. However, medical leaves, including pregnancy and childbirth leaves, may extend this time. Failure to be promoted from assistant teaching professor results in dismissal from the ranks.\n\nWhile there is no explicit limit on the number of years someone can spend at the Assistant rank, failure to be promoted after six years (accounting for medical leave extensions) typically results in dismissal.

    "question": "Can a faculty member take a paid sabbatical leave before being reviewed for tenure? What are the eligibility requirements?",
    "reference_answer": "Yes, if an Assistant Professor is reappointed for a second contract, they may take a paid, one-semester junior research leave devoted entirely to research/scholarship, usually in the 4th or 5th year before their tenure review. The eligibility requirement is being reappointed after the initial 4-year contract.",
    "pinecone_response": "Yes, a faculty member can take a paid sabbatical leave before being reviewed for tenure. Specifically, an assistant professor who is reappointed is eligible for a one-semester junior faculty leave, which is a form of paid leave. This junior faculty leave can be taken at any time following a successful reappointment but not later than the semester immediately prior to the one in which they will be reviewed for promotion to associate professor with tenure by the P&T Committee.\n\nThe eligibility requirements for taking a sabbatical leave include:\n1. Completion of eight years of service, including the one semester of junior paid leave provided by policy.\n2. Accumulation of at least six semesters of service credit, as six semesters of credit is the minimum draw down for any sabbatical leave.\n3. Approval of the sabbatical request is subject to satisfactory performance and productivity in scholarship, creative activity, and teaching.\n\nAdditionally, the sabbatical leave must be authorized based on the recommendation of the Chairperson of a department, with the approval of the appropriate Dean, the Provost, the President, and the Board of Trustees.",
    "custom_response": "According to the policy, a faculty member's eligibility for a sabbatical leave is contingent on their satisfactory performance and productivity in scholarship, creative activity, and teaching. However, it does not explicitly state whether a paid sabbatical leave can be taken before being reviewed for tenure.\n\nThe policy notes that leaves of absence without pay are not counted in the eight-year limitation on service for untenured, tenure-track professors if the faculty member is unable to continue normal scholarly activities during that period. This suggests that unpaid leaves may have implications for the tenure review process, but it does not address paid sabbatical leaves.\n\nTo determine whether a faculty member can take a paid sabbatical leave before being reviewed for tenure, additional information about their specific circumstances and the department's policies would be needed. \n\nHowever, the policy does state that Assistant Professors will be eligible to request their first sabbatical leave with the completion of eight years of service including one semester of junior paid leave provided by policy 201, which governs their appointment."

    "reference_answer": "An Associate Professor with tenure can only be dismissed for adequate cause related to their professional capacities as a teacher or scholar. Dismissal requires following formal proceedings including written allegations, an opportunity for a faculty hearing, and a report of findings to the President.",
    "pinecone_response": "An Associate Professor with tenure can be dismissed before retirement only for cause. Adequate cause for dismissal must be directly and substantially related to the fitness of the faculty member in their professional capacities as a teacher or scholar. Examples of behavior that may justify dismissal include failure to perform duties, fiscal malfeasance, plagiarism, dishonest research, and sexual harassment. Dismissal will not be used to restrain faculty members in their exercise of academic freedom or other rights under U.S. law.\n\nThe process for dismissal involves several steps:\n1. **Initiation of Proceedings**: The president or the president's delegate initiates the consideration of dismissal by presenting a written statement of the allegations to the speaker of the Faculty Senate. This statement must be framed with reasonable particularity and justify dismissal if established.\n2. **Formal Hearing**: The faculty member will be dismissed for cause only after having an opportunity for a formal hearing by a faculty Hearing Panel convened for this purpose. The Faculty Senate, in consultation with the president, establishes the procedure for dismissal hearings. The hearing must ensure written notice of the allegations, the presumption of fitness until proven otherwise, confidentiality, an unbiased panel, and the opportunity for the faculty member to be present, confront and question witnesses, and provide information in their favor.\n3. **Report of Findings**: Following the hearing, the panel will weigh the evidence and provide a written report containing its findings and recommendations to the president. The president will then inform the Board of Trustees of the decision.\n\nAdditionally, pending a final report by the hearing panel, the administration may temporarily suspend the accused faculty member if their continuance threatens harm to others, the accused, university property, or operations. The faculty member will receive full salary during the suspension period.",
    "custom_response": "According to section 8.a.1, a tenured faculty member, including an Associate Professor, can only be dismissed for cause related to their professional capacity as a teacher or scholar. Dismissal due to discontinuance or reduction of programs or departments is an exception, as stated in section 8.c.\n\nIf the dismissal is not related to program discontinuance or reduction, it must be based on adequate cause directly and substantially detracting from the faculty member's professional capacity.\n\nThe termination process for tenured faculty members is not explicitly outlined, but sections 5.f. Termination process and 5.d. Retirement process suggest that a separate procedure applies for non-tenured faculty."

    "reference_answer": "The policy states that the first two informal stages may be bypassed 'in the cases noted above' - referring to cases involving alleged sexual harassment or research misconduct. For those types of allegations, the relevant university policies on sexual harassment (Policy 830) and research misconduct (Policy 324) would dictate the investigative procedures to follow instead of the initial informal stages outlined here.",

How can confidentiality be maintained if lawyers are permitted to be present as stated in 3c?",
    "reference_answer": "While the presence of lawyers could make maintaining full confidentiality more challenging, the policy does not provide details on what specific confidentiality measures would be taken. However, it seems the intent is to keep proceedings as private as possible while still allowing legal representation. Typical measures like closed hearings, confidentiality agreements, and limiting discussion of the case could help preserve confidentiality to a reasonable degree despite having lawyers involved.",
    "pinecone_response": "Confidentiality during the hearing process can still be maintained even with the presence of lawyers, as the procedures are designed to ensure that all participants, including legal counsel, adhere to strict guidelines that protect the privacy of the proceedings. According to section 3c, the hearing will be presided over by the chair of the panel, who will establish the guidelines for the hearing, control the hearing, and ensure that lawyers do not overstep the bounds of what is appropriate in a hearing conducted by faculty colleagues in the efficient pursuit of truth. Additionally, the investigatory process is intended to be confidential, and reasonable and appropriate steps are taken to protect the confidentiality of the proceedings, participants, and evidence gathered.

This suggests that speech that is irrelevant to the academic subject being taught and is controversial could also be seen as failing to exercise appropriate restraint.\n\nOverall, the guidance on what constitutes 'appropriate restraint' includes being accurate, respectful, and clear about not representing the institution, as well as avoiding the introduction of unrelated controversial matters in academic settings.",

In principle, all instructional faculty should receive the same rights regarding free inquiry, classroom discussions, and extramural speech.

This list is developed in consultation with the department faculty.\n\n2. **Candidate's List**: The candidate is then asked to provide a list of potential external reviewers. This list includes individuals without a personal or professional conflict of interest, as well as collaborators, former advisors, and supervisors.\n\n3. **Merging Lists**: Once the department's list is complete, it is merged with the candidate's list. Any names that overlap are designated as \"department, also candidate\" and count toward the minimum number of four letters from reviewers suggested by the department.\n\n4. **Final Selection**: The chair consults with the dean to discuss the final selection of external reviewers. The final list must be approved by the dean. The selection aims to ensure a balance between the number of department-specified and candidate-specified reviewers.\n\n5. **Conflict of Interest Considerations**: External reviewers should be chosen from recognized leading scholars in the candidate's field and should normally be from programs or departments of comparable quality to Rice. If it is necessary to use individuals with a potential conflict of interest, the department must identify the relationship and explain why it is beneficial or necessary to use those persons.\n\n6. **Diversity of Expertise**: In cases where a candidate's work involves more than one sub-field or discipline, it is critical that the reviewers provide a range of expertise that matches the candidate\u2019s interdisciplinary content.\n\nBy following these steps, the department ensures that the selection of external reviewers is thorough, balanced, and fair, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's qualifications for tenure.",

University professorships require approval by the Board, whereas endowed and distinguished professorships do not. Specifically, the awarding of a university professorship involves the provost informing the awardee in writing after recommendation by the Board, whereas awarding an endowed or distinguished professorship involves consultation with the school's honorary title committee and then presenting it to the president for approval, also followed by written notification from the provost."

This includes updating disclosures as relationships evolve and ensuring transparency with department chairs and supervisors.\n\n2. **Management of Conflicts of Interest (COI)**: Consulting for a company that has licensed the faculty member's Rice-developed technology is considered a manageable conflict of interest. However, it requires additional review and management to mitigate risks. The faculty member must ensure that their consulting activities do not conflict with their institutional responsibilities or other obligations to Rice University.\n\n3. **Legal Agreements**: The faculty member must ensure that a legal agreement is in place to address any potential intersection of intellectual property between Rice and the outside entity. This includes the inclusion of the Rice Addendum to Faculty Consulting or Related Agreement as an addendum to the consulting agreement.\n\n4. **Impact on Institutional Responsibilities**: The consulting activities should not impair the faculty member's ability to perform their institutional responsibilities for Rice or fully enjoy academic freedom. They should consider how restrictions on the flow of information may affect their or their students' ability to participate in the free discourse of scholarship.\n\n5. **Special Considerations**: The Faculty Conflicts Committee (FCC) will likely consider the conflict of interest manageable and work with the faculty member to mitigate the risk. This includes ensuring that the consulting activities do not undermine Rice University's basic missions of education and research.\n\n6. **Use of University Resources**: If the consulting activities involve the use of university personnel, students, facilities, or materials, appropriate contractual agreements and prior written approval by the FCC and the Executive Vice President for Research are required.\n\nBy adhering to these considerations and requirements, the faculty member can ensure that their consulting role aligns with Rice University's policies and maintains the integrity of their institutional responsibilities.",

The faculty member must disclose the business interest on their COI form, and disclose it to any involved students. A management plan may include requirements like having the student meet periodically with the department, assigning a co-advisor, or allowing the student to request a different project to avoid potential conflicts impacting their academic progress. Retaliation against students for raising concerns is prohibited.",
    "pinecone_response": "Yes, students can be involved in a faculty member's outside business activities or startups under certain conditions. The policy requires several safeguards to ensure that the involvement does not negatively impact the students' educational experience or create conflicts of interest.\n\n1. **Disclosure**: The arrangement must be disclosed on the Scholar\u2019s Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure form, and the business interest must be disclosed to the student.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Student's Academic Duties**: Scholars must prioritize the student's academic duties and rights while avoiding conflicts. This is particularly important if the Scholar holds a supervisory or advisory role over the student.\n\n3. **Management Plan**: Additional requirements may be detailed in the Management Plan, such as requiring disclosure to the student, periodic meetings with the dean\u2019s office or department, or assigning a co-advisor.\n\n4. **Student Rights**: Students have the right to discuss their concerns about potential conflicts with their deans\u2019 offices, the Office of Research Integrity, and anonymously through the Ethics Line. They may also request to be placed on a different research project not impacted by the potential conflict, although this is subject to the availability of substitute projects and suitable funding.\n\n5. **Protection from Retaliation**: Throughout this process, students are protected from retaliation in accordance with Rice policies.\n\nThese safeguards are designed to ensure that the educational success of students is not compromised by their involvement in a faculty member's outside business activities or startups.",
    "custom_response": "Yes, students can be involved in a faculty member's outside business activities or start-ups, but with certain conditions. According to policy F, if the arrangement is disclosed on the Scholar's COI disclosure form and the business interest is disclosed to the student, then students may be involved.

    "reference_answer": "Yes, that situation would present an actual conflict of interest per Section IV.E. Since the faculty member controls funding on both sides and has a financial stake in the outside entity, there is a risk of bias or improper benefit. The conflict would need to be disclosed and managed through an approved plan prior to research activities commencing or funding being exchanged. Potential management strategies could include appointing a co-PI without the conflict on one of the projects or implementing oversight procedures.",
    "pinecone_response": "Yes, if a faculty member serves as a principal investigator on both a Rice research project and a related project for an outside company in which they have a financial interest, this situation presents a conflict of interest (COI). This is because the faculty member would be in a position to influence both the Rice portion of the award and the outside entity\u2019s portion of the award, which creates the risk of an actual or perceived COI.\n\nTo manage this conflict of interest, a Management Plan must be enacted prior to the commencement of the research activities or the exchange of funding.

The Management Plan should describe the conflict, create an explicit agreement between the faculty member and Rice to manage the conflict, and facilitate oversight of the conflict.",

Additionally, serving on a board of an outside entity is considered an outside activity that must be disclosed.",

According to the policy, any service on a board (for-profit, non-profit, advisory, honorary, or otherwise) is considered an Outside Activity and must be disclosed. Additionally, any equity interest in an Outside Entity is considered an Outside Interest and must also be disclosed.",
    "custom_response": "No. The policy notes that participation in professional, charitable or civic organizations outside the University may mutually benefit the organization, the community and the University. However, it also states that an employee must avoid any situation where the nature or amount of outside activity could, either directly or by appearance, impair the employee's impartiality or effectiveness in performing University responsibilities.\n\nService on outside boards and entities is generally not considered a conflict of interest as long as such matters do not unreasonably detract from the employee's fulfilling their job duties or conflict with the University's objectives or goals. Consulting arrangements (with or without pay) or other outside business interests where there is a risk of an actual or potential conflict of interest must be disclosed in writing to and discussed with one's supervisor.\n\nIn this case, the faculty member has equity interest in the company for which they are serving on an advisory board. This would likely require disclosure under the policy. However, since consulting arrangements are mentioned separately from outside business interests, it is unclear if service on a board should be considered a separate entity requiring disclosure. Nonetheless, given that the faculty member will not be making or participating in decisions as part of their University responsibilities related to this position and is serving on an advisory capacity only, disclosing would still be necessary to confirm this."
