Completion of eight years of service, including the one semester of junior paid leave provided by policy.\n2. Accumulation of at least six semesters of service credit, as six semesters of credit is the minimum draw down for any sabbatical leave.\n3.

Dismissal will not be used to restrain faculty members in their exercise of academic freedom or other rights under U.S. law.\n\nThe process for dismissal involves several steps:\n1. **Initiation of Proceedings**: The president or the president's delegate initiates the consideration of dismissal by presenting a written statement of the allegations to the speaker of the Faculty Senate. This statement must be framed with reasonable particularity and justify dismissal if established.\n2. **Formal Hearing**: The faculty member will be dismissed for cause only after having an opportunity for a formal hearing by a faculty Hearing Panel convened for this purpose. The Faculty Senate, in consultation with the president, establishes the procedure for dismissal hearings. The hearing must ensure written notice of the allegations, the presumption of fitness until proven otherwise, confidentiality, an unbiased panel, and the opportunity for the faculty member to be present, confront and question witnesses, and provide information in their favor.\n3. **Report of Findings**: Following the hearing, the panel will weigh the evidence and provide a written report containing its findings and recommendations to the president. The president will then inform the Board of Trustees of the decision.\n\nAdditionally, pending a final report by the hearing panel, the administration may temporarily suspend the accused faculty member if their continuance threatens harm to others, the accused, university property, or operations.

This includes updating disclosures as relationships evolve and ensuring transparency with department chairs and supervisors.\n\n2. **Management of Conflicts of Interest (COI)**: Consulting for a company that has licensed the faculty member's Rice-developed technology is considered a manageable conflict of interest. However, it requires additional review and management to mitigate risks. The faculty member must ensure that their consulting activities do not conflict with their institutional responsibilities or other obligations to Rice University.\n\n3. **Legal Agreements**: The faculty member must ensure that a legal agreement is in place to address any potential intersection of intellectual property between Rice and the outside entity. This includes the inclusion of the Rice Addendum to Faculty Consulting or Related Agreement as an addendum to the consulting agreement.\n\n4. **Impact on Institutional Responsibilities**: The consulting activities should not impair the faculty member's ability to perform their institutional responsibilities for Rice or fully enjoy academic freedom. They should consider how restrictions on the flow of information may affect their or their students' ability to participate in the free discourse of scholarship.\n\n5. **Special Considerations**: The Faculty Conflicts Committee (FCC) will likely consider the conflict of interest manageable and work with the faculty member to mitigate the risk. This includes ensuring that the consulting activities do not undermine Rice University's basic missions of education and research.\n\n6. **Use of University Resources**: If the consulting activities involve the use of university personnel, students, facilities, or materials, appropriate contractual agreements and prior written approval by the FCC and the Executive Vice President for Research are required.\n\nBy adhering to these considerations and requirements, the faculty member can ensure that their consulting role aligns with Rice University's policies and maintains the integrity of their institutional responsibilities.",
